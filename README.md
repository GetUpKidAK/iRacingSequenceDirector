# iRacing Sequence Director

An editing tool for iRacing replays. Create a sequence of 'nodes' consisting of a time, driver and camera and the application will play back the sequence of shots for recording or viewing. Includes support for recording in iRacing itself using the built-in capture facility (no need for any external software) or can be used with capture software (OBS, etc.) with overlays.

Each replay has its own save file so no need to edit everything in one session.

## Notes

- To use the in-sim recording, the 'Enable video and screen capture' setting must be enabled in-sim.
This requires the sim to be restarted if any changes are made.

- You can adjust the output quality and file format of the recordings in the app.ini file.
This is found under My Documents/iRacing. The lines are commented but look like this:
